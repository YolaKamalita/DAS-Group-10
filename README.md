Analyzing film attributes that can influence the rating through the application of Generalized Linear Model (GLM).

1.calculate the number of NA, if the proportion is not large, we can remove it, if the number is large, maybe we need to fill with the mean value.

2.for each type of movie, select them individually, and then calculate their average rating? then we can know what kind of movies have higher rating.
